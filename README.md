# simple http server in go

## description
in this project, I wanted to use the gorilla mux library and tried to implement two purposes. first, a simple rest api project in golang and second, try to have a concurrent read and write os exercise by reading/writing in a file concurrently in go

### Is this complete?
No there is no testing in here and the whole code is not clean enough but the idea is pretty much interesting
